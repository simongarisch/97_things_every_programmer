# 97_things_every_programmer

1:  Act with prudence: When under time pressure you can find yourself having to choose between "doing it right" and "doing it quick". The task may be completed quickly while making an honest promise to come back to it later... This is known as deliberate technical debt. The longer you leave it, the worse it gets. Pay off technical debt as soon as possible.

2: Apply functional programming principles: Master the functional programming pagadigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains.

3: Ask, "What Would the User Do?" (You are not the user). You'll find that there's a gap between what users say they want and what they actually do.  It's why the best way to capture requirements is to watch users.

4: Automate your coding standard.

5: Beauty is in simplicity.

6: Before you refactor: take stock of the current codebase, avoid the temptation to rewrite everything, make incremental iterations and test.

7: Beware the share: take care when pulling out shared code into a separate libary. You may be preventing libraries using this code to evolve independently.

8: The Boy Scout Rule: Always leave the campground cleaner than when you found it.

9: Check your code first before looking to blame others.

10: Choose your tools with care.

11: Code in the language of the domain: naming matters / conveys information. Don't make others guess what you mean.

12: Code is design.

13: Code layout matters: easy to scan, expressive layout, compact format. Auto formatting and conformance with style guides.

14: Code reviews: increase code quality and reduce defects. Instead of simply correcting mistakes in code, the purpose of code reviews should be to share knowledge and establish common coding guidelines. Code reviews will flow more easily if the team has coding conventions that are checked by tools.

15: Coding with reason.

16: A comment on comments: comments are necessary for programming, but you can go too far.

17: Comment only what the code cannot say: a comment has zero (or negative) value if it is wrong. As the codebase evolves comments may not get updated to the point where they could be misleading. Try to express as much as possible through code.

18: Continuous learning. 

19: Convenience is not an -ility.

20: Deploy early and often.

21: Distinguish business exceptions from technical.

22: Do lots of deliberate practice: Research over the last two decades has shown that the main factor in acquiring expertise is time spent doing deliberate practice. Innate ability is not the main factor.

23: Domain specific languages: always take the target audience into account.

24: Don't be afraid to break things.

25: Don't be cute with your test data: when writing any text in your code- whether comments, logging, dialogs, or test data - always ask yourself how it will look if it becomes public. It will save some red faces all around.

26: Don't ignore that error.

27: Don't just learn the language, understand the culture.

28: Don't nail your program into the upright position: Beware the try, except, pass...

29: Don't rely on 'magic happens here': Another department was running smoothly - projects delivered on time, no late-night debugging sessions, no emergency fixes. So smoothly, in fact, that senior management decided that things 'ran themselves', and it could do without the project manager. Within six months, the projects in the department looked just like the rest of the organization - late, buggy, and continually being patched.

30: Don't repeat yourself (DRY).

31: Don't touch that code: if it's broke, production is not the place to fix it.

32: Encapsulate behavior, not just state.

33: Floating-point numbers aren't real: since floating-point numbers are approximations of real numbers, there is inevitably a little error present. This error, called roundoff, can lead to surprising results.

34: Fulfill your ambitions with open source.

35: The golden rule of API design: it's not enough to write tests for an API you develop; you have to write unit tests for code that uses your API.

36: The guru myth.

37: Hard work does not pay off: if you just set off in one direction, running as fast as you can, you might impress some, but you are not likely to succeed. You need to keep a sustainable pace, and you need to adjust course when you learn more about where you are and where you are heading.

38: How to use a bug tracker.

39: Improve code by removing it: YAGANI - You Aren't Gonna Need It.

40: Install me: convenient install and docs.

41: Interprocess communication affects application response time.

42: Keep the build clean.

43: Know how to use command line tools.

44: Know well more than two programming languages.

45: Know your IDE.

46: Know your limits.

47: Know your next commit.
