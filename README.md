1:  Act with prudence: When under time pressure you can find yourself having to choose between "doing it right" and "doing it quick". The task may be completed quickly while making an honest promise to come back to it later... This is known as deliberate technical debt. The longer you leave it, the worse it gets. Pay off technical debt as soon as possible.

2: Apply functional programming principles: Master the functional programming pagadigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains.

3: Ask, "What Would the User Do?" (You are not the user). You'll find that there's a gap between what users say they want and what they actually do.  It's why the best way to capture requirements is to watch users.

4: Automate your coding standard.

5: Beauty is in simplicity.

6: Before you refactor: take stock of the current codebase, avoid the temptation to rewrite everything, make incremental iterations and test.

7: Beware the share: take care when pulling out shared code into a separate libary. You may be preventing libraries using this code to evolve independently.
