# 97_things_every_programmer

1:  Act with prudence: When under time pressure you can find yourself having to choose between "doing it right" and "doing it quick". The task may be completed quickly while making an honest promise to come back to it later... This is known as deliberate technical debt. The longer you leave it, the worse it gets. Pay off technical debt as soon as possible.

2: Apply functional programming principles: Master the functional programming pagadigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains.

3: Ask, "What Would the User Do?" (You are not the user). You'll find that there's a gap between what users say they want and what they actually do.  It's why the best way to capture requirements is to watch users.

4: Automate your coding standard.

5: Beauty is in simplicity.

6: Before you refactor: take stock of the current codebase, avoid the temptation to rewrite everything, make incremental iterations and test.

7: Beware the share: take care when pulling out shared code into a separate libary. You may be preventing libraries using this code to evolve independently.

8: The Boy Scout Rule: Always leave the campground cleaner than when you found it.

9: Check your code first before looking to blame others.

10: Choose your tools with care.

11: Code in the language of the domain: naming matters / conveys information. Don't make others guess what you mean.

12: Code is design.

13: Code layout matters: easy to scan, expressive layout, compact format. Auto formatting and conformance with style guides.

14: Code reviews: increase code quality and reduce defects. Instead of simply correcting mistakes in code, the purpose of code reviews should be to share knowledge and establish common coding guidelines. Code reviews will flow more easily if the team has coding conventions that are checked by tools.

15: Coding with reason.

16: A comment on comments: comments are necessary for programming, but you can go too far.

17: Comment only what the code cannot say: a comment has zero (or negative) value if it is wrong. As the codebase evolves comments may not get updated to the point where they could be misleading. Try to express as much as possible through code.

18: Continuous learning. 

19: Convenience is not an -ility.

20: Deploy early and often.

21: Distinguish business exceptions from technical.

22: Do lots of deliberate practice: Research over the last two decades has shown that the main factor in acquiring expertise is time spent doing deliberate practice. Innate ability is not the main factor.

23: Domain specific languages: always take the target audience into account.

24: Don't be afraid to break things.
